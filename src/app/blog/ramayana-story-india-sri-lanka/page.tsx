                righteousness and love always prevail, and how compassion can overcome any challenge.

                  Rama was heartbroken when he discovered Sita was missing. He met Hanuman and the monkey army who 
                  promised to help find her. Hanuman used his magical powers to jump across the ocean from India to 
                  Sri Lanka. He found Sita in Ravana&apos;s garden and gave her Rama&apos;s ring to show she was not forgotten.

                  He set fire to the golden city with his burning tail, but made sure not to hurt innocent people. 
                  When he jumped back to India, he carried with him Sita&apos;s jewel as proof that he had found her.

                  During the great battle in Lanka, Lakshmana was badly hurt by a poisoned arrow from Ravana&apos;s son. 
                  He fell unconscious and was dying. The only medicine that could save him was a special herb called 
                  &quot;Sanjeevani&quot; that grew on a mountain in the far-away Himalayas.

                  lifted the entire mountain and flew back to Lanka! On his way, a piece of the mountain fell near 
                  Galle in Sri Lanka - this is now called Rumassala Hill, where you can still find rare healing plants today.

                  To reach Lanka, Rama&apos;s army faced a big challenge - how to cross the vast ocean? The wise bear Jambavan 
                  suggested building a bridge. Under the guidance of Nala and Nila (sons of the divine architect Vishvakarma), 
                  thousands of monkeys and bears worked together to build an incredible bridge across the sea.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  This amazing bridge was made of huge rocks, trees, and mountains that the monkeys carried from far away. 
                  Hanuman and other mighty monkeys could lift entire hills! Each stone floated on water because they wrote 
                  Rama&apos;s holy name on them. The bridge was 100 yojanas (about 800 miles) long and took just 5 days to build.

                  This bridge is known today as <strong>Adam&apos;s Bridge</strong> or <strong>Rama Setu</strong>. You can still see

                  Pamban Island in India and Mannar Island in Sri Lanka. Even today, scientists and archaeologists study 
                  this natural formation that connects the two countries.

                  When they reached Lanka, there was a great war between good and evil. Many brave warriors fought on 
                  both sides. Ravana had ten heads and twenty arms, making him very powerful. But Rama&apos;s arrows were 
                  blessed by the gods. Finally, Rama defeated Ravana with his special arrow, and righteousness prevailed. 
                  The earth shook and the heavens celebrated when Ravana fell.

                  After Ravana was defeated, some people questioned whether Sita had remained pure while living in 
                  Lanka. To prove her faithfulness and purity, Sita asked for a test by fire. She walked into a 
                  burning fire, but the fire god protected her because she was completely innocent and faithful.

                  The fire didn&apos;t harm her at all - not even her clothes were burned! This miracle proved to everyone

                      When Lakshmana was dying from a poisoned arrow, time was running out. Hanuman had to bring the 
                      life-saving Sanjeevani herb from the Himalayas before sunrise, or Lakshmana would die forever.

                      Flying at incredible speed while carrying the entire mountain, Hanuman was racing against time. 
                      As he flew over the ocean near Galle in Sri Lanka, a piece of the mountain broke off and fell 
                      into the sea, creating what we now call Rumassala Hill.

                      only in the Himalayas - thousands of miles away! These include rare medicinal herbs that have

                      The original Ramayana was written by <strong>Sage Valmiki</strong> in ancient Sanskrit around 500-400 BCE. 
                      His 24,000 verses became the foundation for all other versions. Both countries have their own 
                      beautiful adaptations in local languages.

                    <p>
                      In Sri Lanka, there are beautiful Sinhala and Tamil versions. The Tamil poet <strong>Kambar</strong> 
                      wrote the famous "Kamba Ramayanam" in the 12th century, which is very popular in both Tamil Nadu 
                      and Sri Lanka. Other notable authors include <strong>Tulsidas</strong> (Hindi), <strong>Krittibas</strong> (Bengali), 
                      and many Sinhala poets.

                    <p>
                      Each writer added their own cultural touches while keeping the main message of righteousness 
                      prevailing. Even today, you can watch traditional dance performances, puppet shows, and plays 
                      based on these different versions in both India and Sri Lanka.
