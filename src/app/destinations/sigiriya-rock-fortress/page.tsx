            <div className="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
              <p>
                The story of Sigiriya reads like a dramatic movie script filled with family betrayal, royal ambition,
                and ultimate tragedy! In the 5th century AD, Prince Kashyapa committed the ultimate crime - he killed
                his own father, King Dhatusena, to steal the throne from his younger brother Moggallana, who was the
                rightful heir according to royal tradition.
              </p>
              <p>
                After this terrible deed, Kashyapa knew his brother would return someday to seek revenge. So he made
                an incredible decision - instead of living in the traditional royal palace in Anuradhapura, he would
                build an completely new capital city on top of this massive rock, 200 meters high in the sky, where
                no army could easily reach him.
              </p>
              <p>
                For 18 amazing years (477-495 AD), Kashyapa ruled from his sky-high palace, complete with beautiful
                gardens, swimming pools carved from solid rock, and stunning wall paintings. He turned this natural
                rock formation into the most incredible fortress-palace the world had ever seen, using the most
                advanced engineering and artistic skills of ancient Sri Lanka.
              </p>
              <p>
                But the story has a tragic ending. In 495 AD, his brother Moggallana finally returned with a powerful
                army. During the final battle at the base of the rock, Kashyapa&apos;s war elephant suddenly turned back
                toward his own troops. His soldiers thought their king was retreating in fear, so they started running
                away too. Seeing his army abandon him and knowing he was defeated, the proud king took his own life
                rather than be captured.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the king died, nobody lived in his beautiful palace anymore. Later, Buddhist monks came and
                turned it into a quiet place where they could pray and meditate. The monks stayed there until the
                1400s. Today, people from all over the world visit Sigiriya because it shows how clever and skilled
                ancient builders were.

              <h1>The forgotten rock fortress remained hidden in the jungle until British Army Major Jonathan Forbes stumbled upon it in 1831, sparking the first systematic archaeological studies that would eventually uncover the incredible secrets of King Kashyapa&apos;s ancient citadel.</h1>

                      Your amazing journey begins with the incredible water gardens at the base of Sigiriya Rock. These
                      1,500-year-old gardens are not just beautiful - they&apos;re working examples of ancient engineering
                      that would impress modern architects! The gardens show how smart King Kashyapa&apos;s engineers were,
                      creating a complex water system that still functions perfectly today.

                      Local legends say that King Kashyapa kept crocodiles in some of these pools as an extra layer of
                      security for his fortress. While we can&apos;t prove this story, it shows how creative ancient people
                      were in protecting their homes! The geometric design of these gardens influenced garden design
                      across Asia for centuries.

                    The fountains work using water pressure - no pumps needed! During heavy rains, underground channels
                    fill with water and create enough pressure to make the fountains spray water several feet high.
                    This shows that ancient Sri Lankan engineers understood physics concepts that we use today.

                      the enormous Lion&apos;s Paws! These two massive stone paws are all that remain of what was once a
                      giant lion sculpture that guarded the entrance to King Kashyapa&apos;s palace. Imagine how amazing
                      it must have looked 1,500 years ago when visitors had to walk through the lion&apos;s mouth to reach
                      the royal palace above!
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                      The paws are carved from the natural rock and are incredibly detailed, showing the skill of ancient
                      Sri Lankan stone carvers. Each paw is about 3 meters long and shows individual claws and muscles.
                      Some people believe there were actually secret chambers inside the rock behind the lion sculpture,
                      though this has never been proven. Local legends say the lion&apos;s roar could be heard across the
                      valley as a warning to enemies!

                      This is also where many visitors take a break before the steepest part of the climb. The metal

                      prepare mentally for the final push to the summit. The views from here are already incredible,

                    power and protect the royal family. Some archaeologists think the head and body of the lion were
                    destroyed by natural weathering over the centuries.

                      the Sigiriya frescoes! These ancient paintings are located in a naturally sheltered pocket of the
                      rock face, which has protected them from rain and wind for over 1,500 years. The paintings show
                      beautiful women who might be celestial beings (angels), court ladies, or even members of the royal
                      family - nobody knows for sure, which makes them even more mysterious!

                    <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                      What makes these paintings so special is their incredible quality and the fact that the colors are
                      still bright and clear after all these centuries. The artists used natural pigments made from plants
                      and minerals found in Sri Lanka. You can see similar style paintings in the famous Ajanta Caves in
                      India, showing how art and culture traveled between countries in ancient times.

                      it reflected images like a real mirror! For over 1,000 years, visitors have been writing poems and
                      comments on this wall, creating the world&apos;s oldest guest book. You can still read some of these
                      ancient writings today, though new graffiti is strictly forbidden.

                    The Mirror Wall was made by mixing honey, egg whites, and lime to create an incredibly smooth surface.
                    The ancient writings on it include love poems, religious prayers, and comments about the beauty of
                    the frescoes. Some of these writings are over 1,000 years old!
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-sm text-purple-700">
                    The frescoes show women holding flowers and making hand gestures that have religious meaning in
                    Buddhism and Hinduism. The artists paid incredible attention to details like jewelry, hairstyles,
                    and facial expressions that tell us a lot about ancient Sri Lankan culture and fashion.

                      The summit of Sigiriya is where all your climbing efforts pay off with absolutely incredible rewards!
                      At the top, you&apos;ll find the ruins of King Kashyapa&apos;s magnificent palace and some of the most
                      spectacular views in all of Sri Lanka. Standing here, you can truly understand why the king chose
                      this spot for his royal home - it&apos;s like being on top of the world, with endless green landscapes
                      stretching out in every direction as far as your eyes can see.

                      From the summit, you can clearly see Pidurangala Rock rising nearby - another important ancient site
                      that&apos;s also worth visiting for even better views of Sigiriya itself. On clear days, you can see
                      mountains in the distance and the ancient irrigation systems that still feed farms throughout the
                      region. This view helps you understand how powerful and strategic this location was for controlling
                      the entire central region of ancient Sri Lanka.

                      The palace ruins themselves are fascinating to explore. You can walk through the foundations of the
                      royal apartments, see where the king held court, and marvel at the royal swimming pool that was
                      carved directly from the solid rock. Imagine living in luxury 200 meters above the ground,
                      surrounded by the most beautiful gardens and fountains, with the entire kingdom spread out below you!

                    Take your time at the summit! Many visitors rush to take photos and leave quickly, but this is a
                    special place that deserves at least 30-45 minutes of exploration. Sit quietly and imagine what
                    life was like here 1,500 years ago when this was one of the most important places in Asia.

                      At the summit of Sigiriya, one of the most significant features is the ancient stone throne where
                      King Kashyapa would sit in royal splendor to conduct court business and religious ceremonies.
                      This throne, carved from solid rock and once decorated with precious gems and gold, represented
                      the absolute peak of power in ancient Sri Lanka - both literally and figuratively!
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                      The throne was strategically positioned so that anyone approaching would have to climb hundreds of
                      steps and walk through multiple ceremonial gateways before finally reaching the king. This journey
                      was designed to humble visitors and demonstrate the king&apos;s power and authority. The throne also
                      offered panoramic views of the surrounding landscape, allowing the king to survey his domain.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                      Archaeological evidence suggests that the throne was once sheltered by an elaborate wooden
                      pavilion with a gilded roof. The pavilion&apos;s posts would have been anchored in the carved holes
                      still visible in the rock today. During ceremonies, cool mountain breezes would have rustled
                      through silk curtains while the king sat in judgment, surrounded by courtiers and guards.

                    Historical records suggest that King Kashyapa would hold elaborate court ceremonies at sunrise,
                    when the first rays of the morning sun would illuminate his golden throne pavilion. This created
                    a dazzling effect that made the king appear to be sitting in divine light - a powerful symbol
                    of his authority as both political and religious leader.

                    The throne&apos;s position at the highest point of Sigiriya wasn&apos;t just for show - it was carefully
                    planned to create perfect acoustics. The king&apos;s voice would carry clearly to everyone in the
                    audience hall, while the surrounding rock walls created natural amplification effects.

                      has been amazing visitors for over 1,000 years! Originally, this wall was polished so smooth and
                      shiny that it worked like a perfect mirror, reflecting the images of people walking by. The ancient
                      builders achieved this incredible shine by mixing honey, egg whites, and lime to create a surface

                      writings include beautiful love poems, religious prayers, comments about the stunning frescoes, and
                      personal thoughts from people who climbed Sigiriya centuries ago. Reading these old writings gives
                      you a magical connection to people from the past who stood in the exact same spot you&apos;re standing now.

                    <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                      Some of the most interesting writings are from the 8th to 10th centuries, when Sigiriya was used
                      as a Buddhist monastery. Monks and pilgrims wrote about their spiritual experiences and the beauty
                      of the frescoes. Later visitors wrote romantic poems comparing the painted women to their loved ones.
                      These writings help us understand how people from different time periods experienced and appreciated
                      this incredible place.

                    One famous 8th-century poem on the wall says: &quot;The ladies who wear golden chains on their breasts
                    laugh and speak with sweet voices... my mind was captured by their beauty.&quot; Another visitor wrote:
                    &quot;I am Budal. The sight of these women makes me want to stay here forever.&quot;

                    These personal messages show that people 1,200 years ago had the same feelings of wonder and amazement

                      Visiting Sigiriya is more than just seeing an ancient building or climbing a big rock. It&apos;s a journey
                      that connects you with the incredible achievements of human civilization. When you stand at the summit,
                      looking out over the same landscape that King Kashyapa saw 1,500 years ago, you become part of a
                      continuous story that links the ancient past with the present moment.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                      This experience will change how you think about what humans can accomplish when they combine vision,
                      determination, and incredible skill. The fact that ancient people could build something so magnificent
                      without modern technology shows the power of human creativity and ambition. Many visitors say that
                      Sigiriya inspires them to think bigger about their own goals and dreams.

                    <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                      Most importantly, Sigiriya teaches us about the importance of preserving cultural heritage. When you
                      climb those ancient steps and see the frescoes that have survived for 1,500 years, you understand
                      why protecting these treasures is so important. You become an ambassador for cultural preservation,
                      carrying the story of Sigiriya with you wherever you go.
